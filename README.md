# FS22_DOUGLAS_FIR_PACK
 Diversify your forest stands and boost your income with the Douglas Fir Pack. 
 
 The Douglas fir is a North American conifer that can grow up to 40 meters tall! Renowned for the quality of its timber, it offers a great way to expand your forestry production. You can purchase seedling pallets from the store, plant them, and watch them grow. These trees are fully harvestable with forestry equipment and can be sold at the sawmill. But beware of appearances—an overgrown Douglas fir, while highly profitable, can quickly render your harvesters useless. Whether you're a die-hard productivity enthusiast or simply enjoy the forest ambiance, this tree pack is perfect for your farm.
